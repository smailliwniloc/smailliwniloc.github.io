\section*{Question 3}
\begin{question*}
Which of the following functions are differentiable at z = 0?
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
\item $f(z) = (Re(z))(Im(z))$
\item $f(z) = Re(z) + Im(z)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question*}

First, I will note that we can express any $z \in \mathbb{C}$ as $z = x + iy$ implying that Re($z) = x$ and Im($z) = y$.\\
\\Next, note that if we let $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ for $z = x + iy$ in some open set $G$, then if $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ have continuous first order partial derivatives in $G$ and satisfy both $u_x(x_0, y_0) = v_y(x_0,y_0)$ and $v_x(x_0,y_0) = -u_y(x_0,y_0)$ at the point $z_0 = x_0 + iy_0$, then $f$ is differentiable at $z_0$.

\begin{answer*}{\textbf{(a)}}
\\If we use $z = x + iy$, then $f(z) = $(Re($z$))(Im($z$)) can be reduced to $f(z) = xy$. This means the functions $u$ and $v$ that we are interested in are $u(x, y) = xy$ and $v(x, y) = 0$. Thus, the partial derivatives that we are interested in are:
\begin{align*}
u_x(x, y) = y && v_y(x, y) = 0 && v_x(x, y) = 0 && u_y(x, y) = x
\end{align*}
Clearly all of these functions are continuous. Additionally, $u_x(0,0) = 0 = v_y(0,0)$ and $v_x(0,0) = 0 = -u_y(0,0)$; thus, $f(z)$ at $z = 0$ satisfies all of the above conditions for differentiability, so \boxed{f(z) \text{ must be differentiable at }z = 0.}
\end{answer*}

\begin{answer*}{\textbf{(b)}}
\\If we use $z = x + iy$, then $f(z) = $Re($z$) + Im($z$) can be reduced to $f(z) = x + y$. This means the functions $u$ and $v$ that we are interested in are $u(x, y) = x + y$ and $v(x, y) = 0$. Thus, the partial derivatives that we are interested in are:
\begin{align*}
u_x(x, y) = 1 && v_y(x, y) = 0 && v_x(x, y) = 0 && u_y(x, y) = 1
\end{align*}
Clearly all of these functions are continuous. However, $u_x(0,0) = 1 \neq 0 = v_y(0,0)$ and $v_x(0,0) = 0 \neq -1 = -u_y(0,0)$; thus, $f(z)$ at $z = 0$ does not satisfy the above conditions for differentiability, so \boxed{f(z) \text{ must not be differentiable at }z = 0.}
\end{answer*}
