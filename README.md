# My webpage

## About the page

This will primarily be a place for me to publish and store some information about myself. This will include personal projects, hobbies, and a professional resume. At the moment, the page is far from complete. In this README, I will display the features currently in place, those in progress, and those to be added in the future. 

### In place

### In progress
* Education/Math page
* Running page

### In the future

* Integrated web app or web game
* Interesting API usage
