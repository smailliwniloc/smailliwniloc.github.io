# Hi, I'm Colin Williams!

## About Me
I'm currently finishing my Master's in Mathematics at [Kansas State University][ksuMath]. My areas of interest are: 
* Scattering Theory
* Geometric Analysis
* Harmonic Analysis
* Functional Analysis
* Machine Learning

If you're interested in seeing what I work on, [go here][math] to check out some of my research as well as a collection of notes, homework, and resources that I find useful. 

Outside of math, I have started working on several programming projects as well. Most of these are available on my [GitHub Homepage][github], and include some Python game development, coding challenges, and my work on this page. I'm not much of an athlete, but I do run from time to time. At some point, I plan on adding a collection of my races and times on a [page][running] here. I'm also a pretty big Nintendo and tabletop gaming fan so you can [check out my gaming library][gaming] on here as well. 

I am currently in index.md
